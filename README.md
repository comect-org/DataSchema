# DataSchema

DataSchema allows a user to generate classes and structural representations of their data formats, as
defined within data files.

Comect uses DataSchema internally. We initially designed it with our needs in mind, but we quickly realised that other
developers may find it useful for their own projects, so we decided to open-source it. Feel free to contribute as
required by your projects.

We designed DataSchema to ease the development of software that uses components written in many programming languages,
which share common data format definitions. For example, DataSchema is suitable for a piece of software that uses a 
TypeScript front-end and a Kotlin back-end.

DataSchema exposes a comprehensive API on top of the CLI interface, which you can use in your own Kotlin-based 
projects.

DataSchema is under development and isn't ready to be used yet. Once it is, check back for instructions on how to 
use it.
